The Minecraft Server in a Box project aims to allow you to download a bukkit or vanilla minecraft server and configuration, run it, then save it back to the server again - therefore having a portable minecraft server with a single python script.

Requirements
------------

Java JRE 5 or later (JRE 7 preferred)
Internet Connection
Write permissions in the current working directory.

Running
-------

To run this, simply type "python McSIAB-Client.py" into the terminal. If you are on linux and have not installed PyYAML yet, you will need to prefix the command with sudo so the installation can complete succesfully.
